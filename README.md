# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome â€” I'm Trevor Honer

My name is Trevor Honer.
I created Multicore and the BareMetal Engine because I refuse to watch gamingâ€”its creativity, its community, and its historyâ€”be erased by greed, neglect, or corporate control.

Multicore exists to preserve the soul of multiplayer.
BareMetal exists to restore game development to its roots: fast, efficient, and free from GPU tyranny.

These projects are more than software. They're a renaissance.

If we donâ€™t build this â€” no one will.
